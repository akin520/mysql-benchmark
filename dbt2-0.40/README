Please refer to the user manual for instructions on how to use this package.
After that, read README-* if they apply to your case.

The data analsys scripts requires two additional Perl packages to be instealled,
which are not checked by configure.  They are Statistics::Descriptive and
Test::Parser.  To generate HTML reports, Test::Reporter is required.

To use the scripts for multi-tier testing, ssh keys needs to be set up for
the user that owns the kit, preferably without a passphrase being set.  To
keep the scripts simple, the kit needs to be installed in the same location
on each system.  Each user must also have sudo privileges, also preferbly
without needing a password.  Also review each additional README-* related
to your environment for any additional specific details.
