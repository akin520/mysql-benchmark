\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to list the places where the OSDL Database
Test 2 (OSDL-DBT-2) test kit deviates from the TPC-C Standard Specification
Revision 5.0 (http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/).  OSDL-DBT-2 may use terminology
similar to benchmarks from the TPC or other, but such similarity does not in
any way imply any comparable relationship with any other benchmark.

\section{Database Design}

\begin{itemize}
\item All required fields are not returned to the terminal. [PostgreSQL]
\item The kit currently does not use foreign keys to enforce any integrity
      constraints.  (Clause 1.3)
\item Storage space for a 60-day period is not determined.  (Clause 4.2.3)
\end{itemize}

\section{Database Scaling}

\begin{itemize}
\item By default the data generator for the database scales the database
      properly based on the number of warehouses built.  The scale for all
      the tables, except DISTRICT and ORDER\_LINE, can be manually overridden.
      (Clause 1.4.3)
\end{itemize}

\section{Transactions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Errors resulting in invalid transactions are detected but are not
      reported.  (Clause 2.3.6) [SAP DB]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payment}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case where the selected customer has bad credit,
      the original c\_data is not appended to the new c\_data updated for the
      customer.  (Clause 2.5.2.2) [SAP DB]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delivery}

\begin{itemize}
\item Delivery transactions are not queued and deferred, but are executed
      immediately.  (Clause 2.7.2.1) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]

\item Statistics are not collected for the case when deliveries are not made
      for a district.  (Clause 2.7.2.3) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\end{itemize}

\section{Acid Properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item Test have not been designed to test the ACID properties of the database.
      (Clause 3) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Metrics}

\begin{itemize}
\item The reported throughput does not have a minimum required throughput.
      (Clause 4.1.3) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\item OSDL-DBT-2 does not require reporting (Clause 5.6) nor does it require
      a full disclosure report be published (Clause 8).  An independent audit
      is also not required.  (Clause 9) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\item The pricing of the system under test is not calculated.  (Clause 7)
      [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\end{itemize}

\section{Driver}

\begin{itemize}
\item The driver is currently designed to work with a client program to
      reduce the number of connections to the database.  The driver can be
      used in a way such that it implements most of the client code directly
      to reduce the number of connections to the database from the driver
      program directly, instead of opening a database connection per terminal
      emulated.  (Clause 6.1) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\item The mix of the transactions conforms to the TPC-C specification by
      default, but it can be adjusted outside the restrictions placed in the
      specification.  (Clause 5.2.3) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\item The Keying Time and Thinking Time is constant but can be user defined.
      (Clause 5.2.5.7) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\item A maximum 90th percentile response time is not required.
      (Clause 5.2.5.3) [SAP DB, PostgreSQL]
\end{itemize}
